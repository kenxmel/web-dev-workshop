            <h2>The ancient Olympic Games</h2>
            <p>
                The roots of today’s Olympic Games date back to the ancient Olympic Games, held 2,800 years ago. Also known as the "Olympiad," the event took place in the Olympia region of ancient Greece. There are various opinions regarding its origins. It is said that the event was an athletic and artistic festival dedicated to the worship of the gods. But the ancient Olympic Games were hindered by numerous conflicts and finally came to an end in 393 AD.

            <h2>The modern Olympic Games</h2>
            <p>
                Then 1,500 years later in 1892, a French educator named Baron Pierre de Coubertin began the Olympic revival movement. Baron de Coubertin's idea to reinstate the Olympic Games was presented to the audience at the international congress in Paris, 1894, and his proposal was unanimously approved. Two years later the unforgettable first modern Olympic Games were held in Athens, Greece, the homeland of the ancient Olympic Games.
                The five rings — the well-known symbol of the Olympic Games — were also created by Baron de Coubertin, to express the solidarity of the world's five continents.
